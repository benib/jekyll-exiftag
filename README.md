jekyll-exiftag
==============

A LiquidTag to get Exif Tags using EXIFR

## Installation

Place lib/jekyll-exiftag.rb in your _plugins folder

Or install it:

    $ gem install jekyll-exiftag

## Usage

```
{% exiftag tagname,[source],[file] %}
``` 
Everything given as ```tagname``` is called on EXIFR::JPEG, so this could be ```model``` or ```f_number.to_f``` (see https://github.com/remvee/exifr)

If you give a ```source```, this source is used build the fullpath for the given ```file``` (you can also configure them in _config.yml, see below). ```file``` is the complete filename without any path, something like ```photo.jpg```

If you have more than one source configured they are tried one after the other, until a file is found. The source given as a parameter to the liquid tag is used first, then the ones defined in _config.yml

If the ```file``` is given, this is the file to get Exif Tags for, this can be alternatively defined in the YAML Front Matter as ```img: file ```


## Configuration:

Put this in your _config.yml
``` yaml
exiftag:
 sources:
   - photos
   - photos/other_source
```
These paths are relative to your sites root. Don't add leading and trailing slashes.
